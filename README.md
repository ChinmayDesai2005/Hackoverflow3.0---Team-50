# üöÄ Project Information  
We are developing a project named **AapdaMitra** that aggregates information from various sources like social media and news portals. Additionally, we are taking a crowd-sourced approach to address the problem of low or incomplete information during disaster relief efforts.

## üí° How We Identified the Problem  
We learned about this issue during a session with an **NDRF (National Disaster Response Force)** employee at our college. The session focused on basic survival skills for adverse conditions like floods ‚Äî a program our college organizes regularly.  

During the session, the NDRF employee mentioned the challenges disaster relief agencies face due to incomplete or insufficient information during the relief process. After discussing the problem with him, we gained valuable insights into how NDRF operates and decided to develop a solution to help tackle this problem.

## üåç How This Problem Aligns with the "Dynamic World" Theme of HackOverflow  
We believe a **Dynamic World** is one where everything is interconnected, and a single change can have a global impact.  

With the rapidly changing climate conditions ‚Äî increasing cyclones, floods, and other disasters ‚Äî the ability to gather and process information efficiently is crucial. Our solution aims to simplify and speed up the process of collecting information, ultimately improving the efficiency and responsiveness of disaster relief efforts.
